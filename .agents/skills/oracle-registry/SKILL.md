# Oracle Registry

Use this skill when the task is to discover, package, install, or publish skills and tools.

## Focus

- Keep `SKILL.md` small and readable.
- Prefer one skill directory per capability.
- Use references only when the detail is too large for the top level.
- Reuse the ClawHub and OpenClaw registry patterns as the default shape.

## Output

- Package layout.
- Install or publish path.
- Naming and discovery rules.

## Rules

- Avoid underscore-heavy visible labels.
- Keep compatibility notes explicit.
- Do not introduce extra docs unless they reduce repeated reasoning.

## Session Notes
