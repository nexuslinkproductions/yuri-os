# Oracle Router

Use this skill when the job needs one owner context but may detach work into smaller parts.

## Focus

- Keep flow identity separate from business logic.
- Route by capability, not by habit.
- Preserve one clear owner for each task.
- Reuse the taskflow and swarm patterns from `openclaw-openclaw` and the modular execution style from `leon`.

## Output

- Route map.
- Launch order.
- Handoff and wait policy.

## Rules

- Keep conditional logic in the caller.
- Do not scatter routing rules across multiple files unless the split is stable.
- Prefer small, explicit handoffs over hidden background behavior.
