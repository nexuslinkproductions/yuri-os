# Background Task Router

## Usage

- `/bg <task>` — type the slash command followed by the task
- `[bg] <task>` — inserted automatically by `ctrl+b` keybinding, then submit

## Behavior

1. Strip `/bg ` or `[bg] ` prefix
2. Spawn immediately:
   ```
   Agent({
     description: "<3-word task>",
     prompt: "<task> — Caveman terse output. Return result only.",
     run_in_background: true
   })
   ```
3. Output one line: `→ BG: <3-word task>`
4. Return to main thread immediately. Do not wait. Do not narrate.

## Rules

- Never block main thread waiting for the spawned agent.
- Never output more than one confirmation line.
- Ambiguous task = spawn anyway. Background agents can resolve in context.
- Multiple `[bg]` prefixes in one message = multiple parallel spawns (one Agent call per task).
- Always use `run_in_background: true`. Never omit it.
