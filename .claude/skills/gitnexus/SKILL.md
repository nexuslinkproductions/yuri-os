# GitNexus Dispatcher

Use the matching submode for the task:

| Submode | Use |
|---|---|
| cli | analyze, status, clean, wiki, list |
| guide | tool/resource/schema reference |
| explore | architecture and execution-flow discovery |
| debug | root-cause and failure tracing |
| pr-review | pull request risk review |
| impact | blast-radius analysis before edits |
| refactor | graph-aware rename/extract/split/move |

Before editing any function, class, or method, run impact analysis and report blast radius. Before commit, run detect-changes when available.
