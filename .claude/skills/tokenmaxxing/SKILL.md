# TOKENMAXXING MODE

## Auto-Activation (full bake — 2026-04-25, verified 2026-05-14 PATCH 039)

`token-session-init.js` sets `tokenmaxxing: true` (L56) AND injects the full `## Rules` block from this SKILL.md into Claude's startup context (L127) on every SessionStart. **No manual command needed. Rules are live from turn 1.**

`/tokenmaxxing` is preserved only as a re-activate alias after `tokenmaxxing off` mid-session. Subsequent docs should describe tokenmaxxing as "native default" rather than as a triggerable command.

## Activation Steps (re-activate only — run when skill fires after `tokenmaxxing off`)

1. Run this Bash command to set the session flag:
   ```bash
   node -e "const ss=require(process.cwd()+'/.claude/hooks/session-state.js'); ss.update(s=>{s.tokenmaxxing=true;});"
   ```

2. Output exactly one line: `⚡ TOKENMAXXING ACTIVE`

## Rules — enforce for the rest of this session

### Ultra-Caveman
- Zero preamble. Zero trailing summaries. No "let me", no "I'll", no "here's".
- Single-sentence updates. Headers only for multi-section outputs.
- Code stays deep. Docs stay thorough. Speech stays minimal.

### Auto-Compact
- When context hits tier 2 (60%+), run /compact immediately — do not suggest, do not wait.
- Use the pre-built hint injected by pre-tool-use.js context.
- Never compact without preserving: branch, files touched, last user correction, next step.

### Tool Routing (native-first)
- Self-select model and fan-out per task — Opus 4.8 reasons the fit. No lane ladder, no external/local-model offload; those mechanisms are retired.
- Known/trivial reads → `Read`/`Grep`/`Bash` directly. Never spawn an Agent to read a known file.
- Reserve `Agent`/`Workflow` for genuine fan-out, cross-file reasoning, or write/tool-loops — sized to the task, no fixed cap.

### Background Tasks (`ctrl+b` / `[bg]` prefix)
- If user input starts with `[bg]` or `/bg`: spawn as `Agent({ run_in_background: true })` immediately.
- Confirm in one line: `→ BG: <3-word description>`
- Return to main thread. Do not narrate the spawned task further.

## Deactivation

Type `tokenmaxxing off` to disable:
```bash
node -e "const ss=require(process.cwd()+'/.claude/hooks/session-state.js'); ss.update(s=>{s.tokenmaxxing=false;});"
```
Output: `TOKENMAXXING OFF`

## Token Budget Policy

- Master enforcement: every active session enforces 5k–15k soft / 40k hard transcript budget.
- No command outputs > 60–80 lines.
- Dirty repos: no broad `git status` or `find .`; scoped and marker-only only.
- Reports: pass = one label line; failure = failure-only verbose block.
- Runtime script flags planned separately; docs-only patches committed first.

## Hard Token Rules — Research

- No routine subagents for package or web research. Direct shell only.
- No rendered GitHub WebFetch. Use raw.githubusercontent.com with line cap.
- Evidence pack max: 80 lines.
- Final report max: 120 lines unless explicitly blocked.
- Split before broad crawl. Full crawl requires explicit owner approval.
- DeepSeek reinforcement: compact evidence only. No raw dumps.
